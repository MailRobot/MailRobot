MailRobot
=========

Hello Guys! This is the link for our MSE 2202 Project. 
Instructions to use this link: 


1. go to http://github.com/ 
2. Create an account 
3. Send me your username so that I can add you to the managers of this page.

Now you are a manager, and you can access the MailRobot organization as a manager. To be able to save it on your computer and access it, do the following:

1. Download and install Git on your computer from http://git-scm.com/downloads 
2. Now type the following code into Git Hash Application that you will find in the start menu (line by line):

  git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
  
  git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
  
  mkdir Git
  
  cd Git
  
  mkdir MailRobot
  
  cd  MailRobot
  
  git init
  
  git pull https://github.com/MailRobot/MailRobot.git


Now you will be able to have all the directories here stored in your computer. If you want to make any changes, do the following:

1. To get the current status of your git, type:

  git status

2. To commit any changes you made into the database in your computer, type:
  
  git add 'File Name here'
  commit -a -m 'Insert Comment Here'
  
5. To link it to github, insert the following code:

  git pull https://github.com/MailRobot/MailRobot.git
  git push https://github.com/MailRobot/MailRobot.git
  

6. It will ask you to enter your username and password, so do so and have your updates up to the website!

If you have an questions, put them in the comments underneath here :)
Good luck guys on the project
